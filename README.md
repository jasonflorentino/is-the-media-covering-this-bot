# ðŸ—ž Is The Media Covering This?
***A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/aretheycovering) for seeing if the media is covering something*** *Spoiler: They are.*

### ðŸ’€ Deprecation Notice
**2022-11-26:** The bot is offline. It was running on free Heroku which is no longer being offered and will be shut down Nov 28. And for now, I won't be migrating it elsewhere. I've also deleted the app in Twitter to ensure a full clean up. I think this means the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/aretheycovering) will either cease to exist or just be dead.

This is the repo for a Twitter bot I made that, when mentioned in a thread, queries a backend service I set up to search new sources.
Since that service gets more info than can fit in a Tweet, I also made a [web app](https://github.com/jasonflorentino/is-the-media-covering-this-webapp)
where you can make searches and view more detailed results.
