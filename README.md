# ðŸ—ž Is The Media Covering This?
***A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/aretheycovering) for seeing if the media is covering something*** *Spoiler: They are.*

This is the repo for a Twitter bot I made that, when mentioned in a thread, queries a backend service I set up to search new sources.
Since that service gets more info than can fit in a Tweet, I also made a [web app](https://github.com/jasonflorentino/is-the-media-covering-this-webapp)
where you can make searches and view more detailed results.
